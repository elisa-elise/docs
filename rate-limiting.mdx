## Overview

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain service reliability for all vendors. Rate limits are applied on a per-vendor basis and are determined by your access configuration.

## Rate Limit Configuration

Your rate limit is based on the number of buildings your vendor account has access to:

- **Rate Limit:** 10 requests per hour Ã— number of buildings you have access to
- _Example: Access to 50 buildings = 500 requests per hour_

### Multiple Bundles

If your vendor account is assigned to multiple bundles, the rate limit for each request is determined by the specific bundle being accessed in that request.

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes standard rate limiting headers to help you track your usage:

| Header                  | Description                                                                               | |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests allowed for your current endpoint and vendor configuration | |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window                         | |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The number of seconds until your rate limit resets                                        | |

These headers follow the [IETF RFC draft standard](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-02.html).

### Example Response Headers

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 500
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 247
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1842
```

## Exceeding Rate Limits

If you exceed your rate limit, the API will return:

- **HTTP Status Code:** `429 Too Many Requests`
- The `X-RateLimit-Reset` header will indicate when you can resume making requests

## Best Practices

To avoid hitting rate limits:

1. **Monitor the headers:** Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` in your responses to track usage
2. **Implement retry logic:** When you receive a 429 response, wait for the duration specified in `X-RateLimit-Reset` before retrying
3. **Distribute requests:** Spread your API calls evenly throughout the hour rather than making bursts of requests
4. **Cache responses:** Store and reuse API responses when appropriate to reduce unnecessary calls
