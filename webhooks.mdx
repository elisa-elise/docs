Webhook events are sent as POST requests to the desired endpoint agreed upon with the EliseAI implementation team.

Best practice is to handle these asynchronously (i.e. record webhook message, return success response, and then separately handle processing) EliseAI tracks deliverability/success of all webhook events. Webhook events are provided with a signature.

<Note>
  **Important:** EliseAI does **not guarantee sequencing** of webhook deliveries. Integrations **must be able to handle events that may arrive out of order**
</Note>

## Configuration

### EliseAI IP Addresses

Whitelist these IPs if needed:

- 44.235.137.208
- 44.235.21.125

### Webhook Signature Verification

All webhook events include a signature for security. To verify authenticity:

```python
WEBHOOK_SECRET = <YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET>
raw_payload = request.get_data(as_text=True)
received_signature = request.headers.get("X-Signature", "")
expected_signature = hmac.new( WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode(), raw_payload.encode(), hashlib.sha256 ).hexdigest()
if hmac.compare_digest(received_signature, expected_signature):
	print("Webhook verified successfully!", data) 
else:
 	print("Invalid signature")
```

**Note:** All webhook events are sent with `event_date` as UTC.
