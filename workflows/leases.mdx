## Overview

The EliseAI Leasing API provides comprehensive access to lease agreements, resident information, and occupancy data for property management operations. This documentation explains the key endpoints, data models, and business logic that vendors need to understand when integrating with our leasing system.

## Base URL

```
https://api.eliseai.com/v2/leases
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require API key authentication via the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Data Models and Business Logic

### Lease Status Values

The `status` field indicates the current state of a lease agreement:

| Status            | Description                                    | Business Logic                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Resident Status Values

The `resident_status` field indicates an individual's status within a lease:

| Status             | Description                        | Business Logic                                  |

### Occupant Type Values

The `occupant_type` field defines a person's relationship to the lease:

| Type          | Description                        | Business Logic                                                       |

### Date Fields Logic

#### Move-In Date (`move_in_date`)

- **Purpose**: When the resident actually moved into the unit
- **Logic**: This may differ from the lease start date if there were delays or early move-ins
- **Null values**: Indicates the person hasn't moved in yet (Future residents, Applicants)

#### Move-Out Date (`move_out_date`)

- **Purpose**: When the resident actually moved out of the unit
- **Logic**: Set when the person physically vacates the unit
- **Null values**: Indicates the person is still living in the unit
- **Validation**: Must be on or after the move-in date

#### Notice Date (`notice_date`)

- **Purpose**: When the resident provided notice to vacate
- **Logic**: Typically 30-60 days before the move-out date, depending on lease terms
- **Null values**: Indicates no notice has been given yet
- **Validation**: Should be before the move-out date

#### Lease Term Dates

- **Start Date**: When the lease agreement begins
- **End Date**: When the lease agreement ends (null for month-to-month leases)

### Renter's Insurance Information

The `renters_insurance` object contains policy details:

```json
{
  "required": true,
  "provider": "State Farm",
  "policy_number": "SF-123456789",
  "coverage_amount": 100000,
  "expiration_date": "2025-01-01",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**Status Values:**

- `pending`: Policy is being processed
- `active`: Policy is current and valid
- `expired`: Policy has expired
- `cancelled`: Policy was cancelled
- `not_required`: Insurance is not required for this lease

## Common Use Cases

```bash
GET /properties/12345/leases?unit_id=u_12345
```

### 3. Get Leases Starting This Year

GET /properties/12345/leases?status=Current
```

### 5. Get Leases with Notice Given

```

## Data Synchronization Notes

### External System Integration

- EliseAI integrates with multiple property management systems (Progress, RealPage, AMH, MRI, Yardi, etc.)
- Each system maps their status values to EliseAI's standard enums
- Data is synchronized regularly to ensure accuracy

### Status Priority Logic

When multiple residents have different statuses on the same lease, EliseAI uses a priority system:

 1. RESIDENT (highest priority)
 2. NOTICE
 3. EVICTED
 4. UNDER_EVICTION
 5. COLLECTIONS
 6. FORMER
 7. FUTURE
 8. APPLICANT
 9. CANCELLED
10. WAITLIST (lowest priority)

### Data Freshness

- Lease data is updated in real-time as changes occur
- Resident status changes are reflected immediately
- Historical data is preserved for audit purposes

## Error Handling

### Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad request - invalid parameters
- `401`: Unauthorized - invalid or missing API key
- `403`: Forbidden - insufficient permissions
- `404`: Not found - resource doesn't exist
- `422`: Unprocessable entity - validation error
- `500`: Internal server error

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Pagination**: Always use pagination for large datasets to avoid timeouts
2. **Filtering**: Use date filters to limit data to relevant time periods
3. **Status Filtering**: Filter by specific statuses when you only need certain lease types
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits to avoid throttling
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for all possible status codes
6. **Data Validation**: Validate date relationships (move-in before move-out, notice before move-out)
