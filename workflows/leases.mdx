## Overview

This documentation explains the business logic and key field meanings for the EliseAI Leasing API. It focuses on understanding the data returned by the `/v2/leases/properties/{property_id}/leases` endpoint and the logic behind status values, dates, and relationships.

## Key Field Logic and Business Rules

### Lease Status Values

The `status` field indicates the current state of a lease agreement:

| Status            | Description                                    | Business Logic                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Applicant**     | Application submitted but not yet approved     | Person has applied but lease is not yet signed or approved        |
| **Future**        | Approved lease with future start date          | Lease is signed but move-in date hasn't arrived yet               |
| **Current**       | Active lease with residents living in the unit | Lease is active and residents are currently occupying the unit    |
| **Notice**        | Lease with notice to vacate given              | Resident has given notice to move out but hasn't moved yet        |

| **Cancelled**     | Lease was cancelled before completion          | Lease was terminated before residents moved in or during the term |
| **Collections**   | Account is in collections for unpaid amounts   | Financial obligations remain unpaid and account is in collections |
| **Other**         | Catch-all for undefined statuses               | Used when status doesn't fit other categories                     |

### Resident Status Values

The `resident_status` field indicates an individual's status within a lease:

| Status             | Description                        | Business Logic                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **RESIDENT**       | Currently living in the unit       | Person is actively residing in the unit         |
| **NOTICE**         | Has given notice to move out       | Person has provided notice but hasn't moved yet |
| **FORMER**         | No longer living in the unit       | Person has moved out of the unit                |
| **FUTURE**         | Will move in on a future date      | Person is scheduled to move in but hasn't yet   |
| **APPLICANT**      | Has applied but not yet approved   | Person is in the application process            |

| **COLLECTIONS**    | Account is in collections          | Financial obligations remain unpaid             |

### Occupant Type Values

The `occupant_type` field defines a person's relationship to the lease:

| Type          | Description                        | Business Logic                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PRIMARY**   | Main leaseholder/head of household | Primary person responsible for the lease, typically the main contact |
| **ROOMMATE**  | Additional adult occupant          | Additional adult living in the unit but not the primary leaseholder  |
| **DEPENDENT** | Minor child or dependent           | Child or dependent who doesn't have lease responsibility             |
| **GUARANTOR** | Financial guarantor                | Person who guarantees payment but doesn't live in the unit           |
| **OTHER**     | Other relationship                 | Catch-all for other occupant types                                   |

### Date Fields Logic

#### Lease-Level Dates (on the `lease` object)

**`Move-In Date (move_in_date)`**

- **Purpose**: Actual move-in date for the lease
- **Logic**: If different lease members move in at different dates, this will be the **earliest** move-in date
- **Null values**: Indicates no one has moved in yet (Future residents, Applicants)
- **Use case**: Track when the lease actually became active

**`Move-Out Date (move_out_date)`**

- **Purpose**: Actual move-out date for the lease
- **Logic**: If different lease members move out at different dates, this will be the **latest** move-out date
- **Null values**: Indicates residents are still living in the unit
- **Use case**: Track when the lease actually ended

**`Expected Move-In Date (expected_move_in_date)`**

- **Purpose**: Expected move-in date for the lease
- **Logic**: If different lease members are expected to move in at different dates, this will be the **earliest** expected move-in date
- **Use case**: Compare planned vs actual move-ins, track delays or early arrivals
- **Note**: May differ from actual move-in date due to delays or early move-ins

**`Expected Move-Out Date (expected_move_out_date)`**

- **Purpose**: Expected move-out date for the lease
- **Logic**: If different lease members are expected to move out at different dates, this will be the **latest** expected move-out date
- **Use case**: Compare planned vs actual move-outs, track extensions or early departures
- **Note**: May differ from actual move-out date due to lease extensions or early terminations

**`Lease Signed At (lease_signed_at)`**

- **Purpose**: Date and time when the lease was signed by all parties
- **Logic**: Includes both resident signatures and property manager/owner counter-signatures
- **Format**: ISO 8601 datetime with timezone
- **Use case**: Track lease execution timeline, determine when lease became legally binding

#### Member-Level Dates (on each `member` object)

**`Move-In Date (move_in_date)`**

- **Purpose**: When this specific resident moved into the unit
- **Logic**: Individual resident's actual move-in date
- **Null values**: Indicates this person hasn't moved in yet

**`Move-Out Date (move_out_date)`**

- **Purpose**: When this specific resident moved out of the unit
- **Logic**: Individual resident's actual move-out date
- **Null values**: Indicates this person is still living in the unit
- **Validation**: Must be on or after the move-in date

**`Notice Date (notice_date)`**

- **Purpose**: When this resident provided notice to vacate
- **Logic**: Typically 30-60 days before the move-out date, depending on lease terms
- **Null values**: Indicates no notice has been given yet
- **Validation**: Should be before the move-out date

#### Lease Term Dates

- **Start Date**: When the lease agreement begins
- **End Date**: When the lease agreement ends (null for month-to-month leases)

### Current Occupant Logic

**`Is Current Occupant (is_current_occupant)`**

- **Purpose**: Boolean flag indicating if this resident is currently occupying the unit
- **Logic**: Calculated based on resident status and occupant type:
  - `true` if resident status is: RESIDENT, RENEWING, NOTICE, or UNDER_EVICTION
  - AND occupant type is: PRIMARY, ROOMMATE, DEPENDENT, or OTHER
  - `false` for GUARANTOR (they don't live in the unit) or inactive statuses

### Renter's Insurance Information

The `renters_insurance` object contains policy details (currently not populated in responses):

**Status Values:**

- `pending`: Policy is being processed
- `active`: Policy is current and valid
- `expired`: Policy has expired
- `cancelled`: Policy was cancelled
- `not_required`: Insurance is not required for this lease

### Phone Numbers

**`Phone Numbers (phone_numbers)`**

- **Purpose**: List of resident's phone numbers with type classification
- **Format**: E.164 format (e.g., "+14155552671")
- **Types**: HOME, MOBILE, WORK, OTHER
- **Note**: Currently not populated in API responses

### Contact Address Logic

**Resident Contact Address**

- **Purpose**: The address used for contacting residents
- **Current Logic**: Resident contact address is their unit address
- **Implementation**: EliseAI currently does not provide a separate mailing address different from the unit address
- **Use Case**: All correspondence, mail, and contact should be directed to the unit address where the resident lives

### Lease Transfers and Takeovers

**Lease Transfers (Onsite Transfers)**

- **Current Status**: EliseAI does not currently expose a dedicated field for lease transfers
- **Future Plans**: A transfer field will be added in future API versions
- **How to Identify Transfers**: Look for the same `resident_id` appearing on different leases
- **Logic**: When a resident transfers from one unit to another, they maintain the same resident ID but appear on a new lease
- **Use Case**: Track residents who move between units within the same property

**Lease Takeovers**

- **Definition**: When a new resident takes over an existing lease
- **Lease ID Behavior**: The same `lease_id` is maintained (lease doesn't change)
- **Status Changes**:
  - Prior primary resident status changes to FORMER
  - New resident is promoted to PRIMARY status
- **Move-In Date Behavior**:
  - New primary resident's `move_in_date` reflects when they took over
  - Prior resident's `move_out_date` reflects when they moved out
  - Lease-level dates may be updated to reflect the takeover timeline
- **Use Case**: Track when leases are transferred between residents without creating new lease agreements

## Key Field Relationships

### Lease vs Member Date Logic

- **Lease-level dates** represent the overall lease timeline
- **Member-level dates** represent individual resident timelines
- Lease dates are calculated from member dates (earliest move-in, latest move-out)
- A lease can have multiple members with different move-in/out dates

### Status Relationships

- **Lease status** reflects the overall state of the lease agreement
- **Resident status** reflects individual resident's state within that lease
- Lease status is determined by the highest priority resident status on the lease
- Multiple residents can have different statuses on the same lease

### Occupant Type vs Current Occupant

- **Occupant type** defines the resident's relationship to the lease (PRIMARY, ROOMMATE, etc.)
- **Is current occupant** indicates if they're physically living in the unit
- GUARANTOR occupant type will always have `is_current_occupant: false`
- DEPENDENT occupant type can have `is_current_occupant: true` if they're living there

## Business Logic and Data Synchronization

### Status Priority Logic

When multiple residents have different statuses on the same lease, EliseAI uses a priority system to determine the overall lease status:

 1. RESIDENT (highest priority)
 2. NOTICE
 3. EVICTED
 4. UNDER_EVICTION
 5. COLLECTIONS
 6. FORMER
 7. FUTURE
 8. APPLICANT
 9. CANCELLED
10. WAITLIST (lowest priority)

### External System Integration

- EliseAI integrates with multiple property management systems (Progress, RealPage, AMH, MRI, Yardi, etc.)
- Each system maps their status values to EliseAI's standard enums
- Data is synchronized regularly to ensure accuracy
- Status values may vary between systems but are normalized to EliseAI's standard values

### Data Freshness

- Lease data is updated in real-time as changes occur
- Resident status changes are reflected immediately
- Historical data is preserved for audit purposes

### ID Format Rules

- **Lease IDs**: Always start with `lease_` prefix
- **Unit IDs**: Always start with `u_` prefix
- **Resident IDs**: Always start with `res_` prefix
- **Property IDs**: Numeric values without prefixes

### Month-to-Month Logic

- **`is_month_to_month`**: Boolean indicating if lease automatically renews monthly
- **`end_date`**: Will be `null` for month-to-month leases
- **Renewal**: Month-to-month leases continue indefinitely until notice is given

### Soft Deletion

- **`deleted_at`**: Timestamp when lease was soft-deleted (null if active)
- **Logic**: Soft-deleted leases are excluded from most queries but preserved for historical purposes

## Important Notes for API Users

### Currently Unpopulated Fields

- **`renters_insurance`**: Always `null` in current API responses
- **`phone_numbers`**: Always empty array in current API responses
- These fields are defined in the schema but not yet populated with real data

### Data Validation Rules

- Move-out date must be on or after move-in date
- Notice date should be before move-out date
- Lease end date must be after start date
- All ID fields must follow the required prefix format

### Status Transition Logic

- Residents typically progress: APPLICANT → FUTURE → RESIDENT → NOTICE → FORMER
- Leases can be CANCELLED at any point before completion
- Eviction process: RESIDENT → UNDER_EVICTION → EVICTED
- Collections status is independent of resident status
