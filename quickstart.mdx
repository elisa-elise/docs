## Prerequisites

Before you begin you'll need:

- A Bearer token (see Authentication section below)
- [Property IDs]
- [some agreement?]

## Authentication

The EliseAI API uses Bearer token authentication. All API requests must include your token in the Authorization header.

### Obtaining Your API Token

To get your API token, contact your EliseAI account representative or reach out to our support team at [support contact]. Once issued, please store your token securely.

### Using Your Token

Include your Bearer token in the Authorization header of every API request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## Making Your First Request

Once you have your token, you can start making requests to the EliseAI API.

### Example: Fetch Prospects

Here's a basic example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.eliseai.com/v2/properties/12345/units \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Make sure to substitute`12345`for a property_id you've been given access to.

### Example: Python

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.eliseai.com/v2/properties/12345/units"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

### Example: JavaScript (Node.js)

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const url = 'https://api.eliseai.com/v2/properties/12345/units';
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

fetch(url, { headers })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. A successful response will return a 200 status code along with the requested data.

```json
{
  "units": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "property_id": "string",
      "unit_number": "string",
      "unit_type": "residential",
      "status": "vacant",
      "bedrooms": 0,
      "bathrooms": 0,
      "square_feet": 1,
      "floor": 0,
      "building": "string",
      "floor_plan": "string",
      "market_rent": 0,
      "available_date": "2025-10-02",
      "created_at": "2025-10-02T17:04:12.402Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-10-02T17:04:12.402Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 156,
    "limit": 100,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
```

## Common Status Codes

| **Code**                      | **Description**                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **200 OK**                    | Request succeeded                        |
| **200 Bad Request**           | Invalid request parameters               |
| **401 Unauthorized**          | Missing or invalid authentication token  |
| **403 Forbidden**             | Valid token but insufficient permissions |
| **404 Not Found**             | Resource not found                       |
| **429 Too Many Requests**     | Rate limit exceeded                      |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | Server error                             |

## Rate Limiting

The EliseAI API does not currently enforce rate limits. However, to ensure optimal performance and prepare for future rate limiting, we strongly recommend implementing request throttling on your end.

**Recommended practices:**

- Implement reasonable delays between requests
- Use batch operations where available
- Avoid making unnecessary or redundant API calls

We will be introducing rate limits in the near future. This documentation will be updated with specific limits and headers once implemented.

## Best Practices

- **Keep your token secure** - Never expose your API token in client-side code or public repositories
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Always check response status codes and handle errors appropriately
- **Respect rate limits** - Implement exponential backoff when encountering rate limits (future)
- **Use HTTPS** - All API requests must be made over HTTPS

## Next Steps

Now that you're authenticated and have made your first request, explore our API reference documentation [add link].
