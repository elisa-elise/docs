## Lease Journeys

### Most Common Lease Journey

```
Applicant -> Future -> Current -> Notice -> Former
```

### Renewal Journey

```
(current lease) Current -> Renewing -> 
(new lease) Future -> Current -> Notice -> Former
```

When the resident decides to renew, a new lease will be created where the status will be **Future** until that new lease starts. At that point the former lease will switch from **Renewing **to **Former.**

### Eviction Journey

```
Current/Notice -> Under Eviction -> Evicted -> Collections
```

## Status Transitions

### Applicant Status

A lease that is in status **Applicant** can transition to: 

- **Future**: if application is approved and lease is countersigned
- **Cancelled**: application was rejected or withdrawn
- **Waitlist**: no immediate availability

### Future Status

A lease that is in status **Future **can transition to: 

- **Current: **when the move-in day arrives
- **Cancelled: **if the lease is cancelled before move-in

### Current Status

A lease that is in status **Current** can transition to: 

- **Notice: **if the resident gives notice to vacate
- **Under Eviction: **if the eviction process is started
- **Renewing: **if the renewal process is initiated

### Notice Status

A lease that is in status **Notice** can transition to: 

- **Former: **move-out date arrives
- **Under Eviction: **eviction filed during notice period

### Former Status

When a lease ends normally, the status becomes **Former**
