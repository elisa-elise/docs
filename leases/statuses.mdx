## Lease Journeys

### Most Common Lease Journey

```
Applicant -> Future -> Current -> Notice -> Former
```

### Renewal Journey

```
Original lease status changes
Current -> Former (when lease ends)

New Renewal lease status
Renewing -> Future -> Current (when renewal starts)
```

Here's the full progression:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Offer Selection">
    - Resident selects a renewal offer
    - New lease created with **Renewing** status
    - New lease **move in** **date** is set to previous lease **move in date**
    - Lease document Generated
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: E-Signature Process">
    - Lease document sent for electronic signature
    - Both resident and management company sign
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Counter-Signing Complete">
    - New lease status changes **Renewing -\> Future**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Lease Start">
    - When lease start date arrives
      - New lease status changes **Future -\> Current**
  </Step>
</Steps>
