## Overview

This documentation explains the business logic and key field meanings for the EliseAI Leasing API. It focuses on understanding the data returned by the `/v2/leases/properties/{property_id}/leases` endpoint and the logic behind fields like statuses values and dates.

## Key Field Logic and Business Rules

### ID Format

- **Lease IDs**: Always start with `lease_` prefix
- **Resident IDs**: Always start with `res_` prefix.

### Lease Status

The `status` field indicates the current state of a lease agreement

View our [Lease Status](/leases/statuses) page for more details.

### Resident Status

The `resident_status` field indicates an individual's status within a lease:

| Status             | Description                        | Business Logic                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **RESIDENT**       | Currently living in the unit       | Person is actively residing in the unit         |
| **NOTICE**         | Has given notice to move out       | Person has provided notice but hasn't moved yet |
| **FORMER**         | No longer living in the unit       | Person has moved out of the unit                |
| **FUTURE**         | Will move in on a future date      | Person is scheduled to move in but hasn't yet   |
| **APPLICANT**      | Has applied but not yet approved   | Person is in the application process            |
| **WAITLIST**       | On waitlist for a unit             | Person is waiting for availability              |
| **UNDER_EVICTION** | Eviction process initiated         | Legal eviction proceedings are active           |
| **EVICTED**        | Has been legally evicted           | Eviction process completed                      |
| **CANCELLED**      | Application or lease was cancelled | Process was terminated                          |
| **COLLECTIONS**    | Account is in collections          | Financial obligations remain unpaid             |

<Info>
  **Lease - Resident Status Relationships**

  - **Lease status** reflects the overall state of the lease agreement
  - **Resident status** reflects individual resident's state within that lease
  - Lease status is determined by the highest priority resident status on the lease. Priority order: RESIDENT, NOTICE, EVICTED, UNDER_EVICTION, COLLECTIONS, FORMER, FUTURE, APPLICANT, CANCELLED, WAITLIST (lowest priority).
  - Multiple residents can have different statuses on the same lease
</Info>

### Occupant Type

The `occupant_type` field defines a person's relationship to the lease:

| Type          | Description                        | Business Logic                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PRIMARY**   | Main leaseholder/head of household | Primary person responsible for the lease, typically the main contact |
| **ROOMMATE**  | Additional adult occupant          | Additional adult living in the unit but not the primary leaseholder  |
| **DEPENDENT** | Minor child or dependent           | Child or dependent who doesn't have lease responsibility             |
| **GUARANTOR** | Financial guarantor                | Person who guarantees payment but doesn't live in the unit           |
| **OTHER**     | Other relationship                 | Catch-all for other occupant types                                   |

<Info>
  **Occupant Type vs Current Occupant**

  - **Occupant type** defines the resident's relationship to the lease (PRIMARY, ROOMMATE, etc.)
  - **Is current occupant** indicates if they're physically living in the unit
  - GUARANTOR occupant type will always have `is_current_occupant: false`
  - DEPENDENT occupant type can have `is_current_occupant: true` if they're living there

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Lease vs Member Date Logic**

  - **Lease-level dates** represent the overall lease timeline
  - **Member-level dates** represent individual resident timelines
  - Lease dates are calculated from member dates (earliest move-in, latest move-out)
  - A lease can have multiple members with different move-in/out dates
</Info>

### Occupancy

**`Is Current Occupant (is_current_occupant)`**

- **Purpose**: Boolean flag indicating if this resident is currently occupying the unit
- **Logic**: Calculated based on resident status and occupant type:

### Renter's Insurance Information

The `renters_insurance` object contains policy details (currently not populated in responses):

**Status Values:**

- `pending`: Policy is being processed
- `active`: Policy is current and valid
- `expired`: Policy has expired
- `cancelled`: Policy was cancelled
- `not_required`: Insurance is not required for this lease

### Resident Contact Information

**Resident Contact Address**

- **Purpose**: The address used for contacting residents
- **Current Logic**: Resident contact address is their unit address
- **Implementation**: EliseAI currently does not provide a separate mailing address different from the unit address

### Lease Transfers and Takeovers

**Lease Transfers (Onsite Transfers)**

- **Current Status**: EliseAI does not currently expose a dedicated field for lease transfers
- **How to Identify Transfers**: Look for the same `resident_id` appearing on different leases
- **Logic**: When a resident transfers from one unit to another, they maintain the same resident ID but appear on a new lease
- **Use Case**: Track residents who move between units within the same property

**Lease Takeovers**

- **Definition**: When a new resident takes over an existing lease
- **Lease ID Behavior**: The same `lease_id` is maintained (lease doesn't change)
- **Status Changes**:
  - Prior primary resident status changes to FORMER
  - New resident is promoted to PRIMARY status
- **Move-In Date Behavior**:
  - New primary resident's `move_in_date` reflects when they took over
  - Prior resident's `move_out_date` reflects when they moved out
  - Lease-level dates may be updated to reflect the takeover timeline
- **Use Case**: Track when leases are transferred between residents without creating new lease agreements
