## Workflow: Determine Billable Occupants

**Use Case**: Utility company needs to determine how many occupants to bill for each unit

**Scenario**: Water/sewer company needs accurate occupant count for billing calculations

**API Endpoint Sequence**:

**Step 1: Get All Active Leases**

```http
GET /v2/leases/properties/{property_id}/leases?status=Current&limit=500&offset=0
```

**Step 2: Handle Pagination (if needed)**

```http
GET /v2/leases/properties/{property_id}/leases?status=Current&limit=500&offset=500
```

**Step 3: Continue until all leases retrieved**

```http
GET /v2/leases/properties/{property_id}/leases?status=Current&limit=500&offset=1000
```

**Response Fields to Use**:

- `lease.unit_number` - Unit identifier
- `lease.id` - Lease identifier
- `members[].is_current_occupant` - Currently occupying (true/false)
- `members[].resident.id` - Resident identifier
- `members[].resident.first_name` - First name
- `members[].resident.last_name` - Last name

**Key Integration Points**:

- Use `is_current_occupant = true` for accurate occupancy status
- Handle pagination for large properties
- Process in batches to avoid API limits
